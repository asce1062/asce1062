### Hey there 👋 I'm Alex Mbugua Ngugi

🔭 **I’m currently working on**

Federated authentication and secure SSO flows for enterprise platforms, improving scalability and user experience across the board. I’m also mentoring engineers and contributing to projects that support millions of learners.

🌱 **I’m currently learning**

- Advanced observability with Datadog and distributed tracing
- Astro framework by building my personal site. [Check it out!](https://github.com/asce1062/asce1062/tree/main/asce1062)

👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on**

- Designing multi-tenant SaaS authentication that gracefully supports both B2B and B2C flows
- Initiatives building resilient infrastructure and serverless architectures
- Open Source Projects in the authentication, DevTools, or EdTech space

💬 **Ask me about**

Content management with Hygraph(graphQL), Auth0, SSO flows, SAML, OAuth, Terraform, serverless patterns on AWS, building progressive profiling flows, or streamlining engineering workflows.

⚡ **Fun fact**

When I’m not contributing to open source projects or reverse engineering things for fun, I compose chip music.

*P.S. I’m open to exciting new opportunities, especially roles where authentication, infrastructure, or education outcomes intersect with impact-driven engineering.* 🚀
