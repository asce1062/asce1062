Fonts Guide

Set FontThe font must be a vector based pixel font (such as miniml fonts) to work properly. Bitmap pixel fonts will not work as shown. For webfonts name the "font-family" with the same 'Fontname' you created in the @font-face declaration (see 3. Webfont Use).

Font SizeMiniml fonts must set to any multiple of 8 (16, 24, 32, etc.) With a Retina display you can set the font at 4 for the smallest pixel font possible. The first 2 numbers after the font name refer to the cap height in pixels. The last 2 numbers refer to the font style.

Webfont UseUse the following stylesheet code:@font-face { font-family: 'Fontname';src: url('fontname-webfont.eot');src: url('fontname-webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),url('fontname-webfont.woff') format('woff'),url('fontname-webfont.ttf') format('truetype');font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;}

Adjust SpacingUse the CSS property "letter-spacing" to adjust the character spacing. Use the CSS property "line-height" to adjust line spacing.

Turn Aliasing to NoneWhen using image editing applications turn Aliasing setting to None to keep fonts aliased, otherwise the fonts will appear blurry.

Fonts in MotionYou need to round the x and y values to whole values to keep the fonts aliased when using the fonts in motion.
