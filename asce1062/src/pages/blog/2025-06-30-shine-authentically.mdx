- Be who you are and say what you feel
- Those who mind, don't matter and those who matter, don't mind
- You weren't meant to be anyone else, you are here intentionally; I am who I am and that's enough
- Don't change who you are to try to please a world that didn't create you
- You are already enough, exactly as you were meant to be
- The ones who matter will love you for who you are without asking you to become something you're not[^1]
- So, shine; not to please the world, but to reflect the glory of something greater

[^1]:1. Matthew 5:16 - In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.
