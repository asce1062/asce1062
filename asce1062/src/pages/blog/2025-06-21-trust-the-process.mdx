- The day you plant the seed, isn't the say you'll eat the fruit
- Growth takes time. Whether it's your goals, healing or your relationships, none of it happens overnight
- Just because you don't see results right away, doesn't mean that nothing's happening
- Roots grow in silence and progress can be quiet, so be patient with the process
- Just because you don't think it's happening yet, doesn't mean it won't
- Because one day, without realising it, you'll look around and you'll see the tree that you grew[^1]
- Like the seed before the fruit, before the tree; everything that we are is already inside us

[^1]:Galatians 6:49 - Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.
