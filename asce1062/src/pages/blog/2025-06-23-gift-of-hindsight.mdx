- If I had the mind I have now, I wouldn't have made the mistakes I made back then
- But if I hadn't made the mistakes I made back then, I wouldn't have the mind I have now
- It's easy to look back and feel regret, to wish we had done things differently
- But the truth is, everything happened the way it was meant to
- Every wrong turn, every setback, every choice. It all led us here
- Maybe here is exactly where we are supposed to be[^1]
- So; do not hold on to the past, make room for what is coming next

[^1]:1. Isaiah 43:18-19 - Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.
