- One man's trash is another man's treasure
- it's easy to forget this when we're constantly presented with other people's highlight reels, their best moments
- We see their lives, their vacations, their achievements and think, "why don't I have that?"
- The man who walks wishes he had a bike, the man with the bike wishes he had a car, the man with the car wishes he had a better one
- But there's a man out there wishing he could walk at all
- It's easy to take our blessings for granted, but it's important to remember that you're living a dream that someone else is praying for
- If you don't appreciate what you have now, how could you appreciate what's to come[^1]
- It's important to find contentment and peace, rather than always constantly chasing after more

[^1]:1. Psalms 23:1 - The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
