- We have two lives, the second one begins when we realize we only have one
- One thing I've found myself struggling with, is going through the motions
- Let's get this day out of the way so I can get onto that greater future
- Or something bad happened to me today, so I'll just get today over with and tomorrow will be better
- But I'm realizing that every single thing happens to us exactly the way it's supposed to
- Some days are not going to be amazing, and not everything is going to be sunshine and rainbows
- Appreciate each day because nothing is guaranteed[^1]
- We can't take today for granted; So instead of waiting for the future, appreciate the now
- Whether it's the people, the opportunities, or the moments that we have right in front of us

[^1]:1. Proverbs 27:1 - Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.
