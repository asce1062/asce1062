# Part 2: IcoMoon Workflow: How to Create & Manage Custom Icon Fonts Easily.

<br/>
In [Part 1](/blog/2025-08-01-how-to-use-icomoon-to-create-and-integrate-high-quality-vector-icon-fonts-part-1) of this series, we covered the basics of getting started with IcoMoon: picking icons, generating your font, and integrating it into your project.

Now it’s time to dive into the fun stuff: **a workflow that keeps your icon font process smooth, consistent, and dare I say, enjoyable**.

<br/>
<br/>
# **Decide on Icons Early in the Design Stage**

Before you even touch a text editor, make the decision to use an icon font. This isn’t just a developer thing, it’s a design choice. Whether you’re the designer or you’re collaborating with one, agreeing to use icons from IcoMoon early on will save a ton of headaches later.

That said… what if you just can’t find the perfect icon? No problem. IcoMoon lets you upload your own SVGs (we’ll explore this in Part 3).

<br/>
<br/>
# **My IcoMoon Workflow**
Once I have the design direction ready and I’m ready to start building the site, here’s the process I follow:

1. Identify all the icons in the design
    - Go through the mockups and note every icon you’ll need.

2. Head to IcoMoon and select those icons (or upload custom ones).

3. Generate your icon font
    - Hit that Font button, review your selection, and download your generated font set.

4. Organize your files
    - Copy all four font formats (`.svg`, `.ttf`, `.woff`, `.woff2`) into your `/fonts/` directory.
    - Keep the original IcoMoon download folder intact, you’ll want `index.html` handy for reference.

5. Keep `index.html` open while coding
    - This file lists all your selected icons along with their unicode values, making it easy to copy and paste the right code.

<br/>
<br/>
# **Updating Your Icon Font Later**
Design change? Client requests a new icon? No sweat. If you’ve kept your IcoMoon folder untouched, you can:

- Reopen your original selection in IcoMoon
- Add or replace icons
- Regenerate the font
- Copy the new font files back into `/fonts/`

> When using IcoMoon, your modifications will automatically get saved in your browser's cache (using IndexedDB).
>
> It does not get uploaded to your user account on IcoMoon's servers. If you clear your browser's cache, this data will be lost.
>
> If you are using a [paid plan](https://icomoon.io/pricing), your changes will automatically get uploaded and synced to your account on IcoMoon's servers.
>
> Always version control the `selection.json` session file from IcoMoon (available in generated font pack .zip you downloaded or accessed from Main Menu → Manage Projects → Project Name → Download). This file is your safety net for making updates in the future.

>
> You may import this file both via the **Import Icons** button in the app, or via the **project manager** (accessed from Main Menu → Manage Projects). If you import your `selection.json` file via the project manager, your project settings will get imported too.

# **Integrating with SASS for Extra Convenience**
These days, I write all my styles in `SASS`, which makes managing icon fonts even easier.

1. Define variables in `_variables.scss`
```scss
$icon-font: "icomoon"; // Your icon font name
$icon-github: "\efc4"; // Unicode for your github icon
```

2. Use pseudo-elements to insert icons
```scss
.foo {
  &:before {
    content: $icon-github;
    font-family: $icon-font;
    speak: none;
    font-weight: normal;
  }
}
```

3. Or extend classes directly from IcoMoon’s `style.css`:
```scss
.foo {
  &:before {
    @extend .icon-github; //found in the downloaded style.css
  }
}
```

<br/>
<br/>
# **Creating a Silent Extendable Icon Class**
For ultimate reusability, I like to make a silent extendable %icon class
```scss
%icon {
  font-family: $icon-font;
  speak: none;
  font-weight: normal;
  font-variant: normal;
  text-transform: none;
  line-height: 1;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}
```

Then use it wherever you need an icon
```scss
.foo {
  &:before {
    @extend %icon;
    content: $icon-github;
  }
}
```
<br/>
And it's that it. As easy as vector based pie!<br/>
This workflow keeps your icons consistent, your code clean, and your future updates painless.

In Part 3, we’ll take things up a notch with some ninja-level IcoMoon tricks that will really unlock the tool’s full potential.
