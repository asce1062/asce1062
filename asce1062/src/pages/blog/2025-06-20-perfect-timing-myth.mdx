- The cost of procrastination is a life you could have lived
- It's not just about time, it's missed chances
- A lot of people wait for the right time to start
- There is no perfect time, you just have to begin
- If you keep waiting for the perfect conditions, you may never move at all[^1]

[^1]:1. Ecclesiastes 11:4 - Whoever watches the wind will never plant. Whoever looks at the clouds will never harvest.
