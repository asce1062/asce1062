- Focus on the step in front of you, not the whole staircase
- So often we get lost in the big picture. Overwhelmed by how far we have to go, or how high we have to climb
- We focus on the summit, forgetting that every step matters
- The journey isn't about the end, it's about the now
- The step you're standing on, the one you can control, is the most important
- Don't let the weight of the whole staircase paralyze you
- Progress isn't always linear and success isn't about seeing the top right away
- It's about moving forward, step by step
- Don't let the fear of the climb stop you from taking the first step[^1]
- The only moment you truly have is this one
- Don't let the fear of what's next rob you of the power of today

[^1]:1. Matthew 6:34 - Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
