- Everything will be okay in the end. So if it's not okay, then it's not the end
- Sometimes everything will be ripped from your hands just to show you that your hands still work
- Sometimes the pain isn't punishment, it's preparation
- The breaking doesn’t mean it's over, it means something real is being built
- Even flowers bloom after the harshest winters, even rivers carve through stone with time
- So no, it might not be okay right now, but that doesn't mean it won't be, because growth and healing take time
- The sorrow that breaks you tonight, is planting the joy that will rise with the sun[^1]

[^1]:1. Psalm 30:5 - weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.
