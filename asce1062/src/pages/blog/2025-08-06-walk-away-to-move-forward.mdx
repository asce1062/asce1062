- You can't heal if you keep touching the wound. Pain remembered is not pain released
- Each time the past is reopened, the present bleeds
- There's no peace in picking at pain just to feel something
- No closure in circling the same hurt, hoping it will say something new
- Wounds only become scars when they're given the chance to stop bleeding[^1]
- Sometimes the healing is found not in the fight to fix what's broken, but in the courage to walk away
- Trusting the process will make you whole again

[^1]:1. Psalm 147:3 - He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.
