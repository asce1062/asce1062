- Perhaps losing what you thought you wanted helped you find what you truly needed
- Sometimes what feels like a setback is just life realigning your path
- You mourn the job, the relationship, the dream, thinking you've lost everything
- But maybe that closed door wasn't rejection it was redirection, because what we want and what we need aren't always the same
- And it's only in the absence of what we chased that we find the quiet truth of what we are meant for
- So if you're hurting from what slipped away, remember this, nothing is subtracted from you, it's replaced with purpose
- What you thought was the end might just be the beginning of what's real[^1]
- A heart that trusts in it's purpose, never walks blindly, it walks faithfully

[^1]:1. Proverbs 16:9 - In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps.
