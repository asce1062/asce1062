	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	<PrivacyPolicy />

	<h3>Do Not Track</h3>
	<p>
		This site honors the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/">DNT header</a>. The tracking status is
		<b>"N" (Not Tracking)</b>, as declared in
		<a href="/.well-known/dnt">/.well-known/dnt</a>. The full policy is available at
		<a href="/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt">/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Security</h3>
	<p>
		Security contact information is published at <a href="/.well-known/security.txt">/.well-known/security.txt</a>,
		signed with a
		<a href="/.well-known/security.txt.sig">detached PGP signature</a>. The public key is available at
		<a href="/public.pgp">/public.pgp</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>WKD (Web Key Directory):</b>
		WKD-based key discovery is not yet available because the current PGP key is issued for an
		<code>@outlook.com</code> address, and WKD requires a key on a domain you control. Once the contact email is updated to
		<code>ping@alexmbugua.me</code>, the public key will be published via WKD at <code>/.well-known/openpgpkey/</code> for
		automatic discovery.
	</p>
	<p>
		Existence of the security.txt file does not imply consent to perform security tests against this site. This site is
		primarily hosted on Netlify with GitHub Pages as a backup. Guestbook data is stored in a self-hosted Turso (libSQL)
		database. All testing must comply with respective hosting provider security policies.
	</p>

	<h3>Third-Party Vendors</h3>
	<p>
		This site does not use advertising or tracking vendors. A full transparency listing of all third-party services used
		by this site is published at
		<a href="/.well-known/pubvendors.json">/.well-known/pubvendors.json</a>.
