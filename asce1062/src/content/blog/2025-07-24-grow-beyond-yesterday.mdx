- No man ever steps in the same river twice; for it is not the same river, and he is not the same man
- Change can feel scary, but scarier is no change at all
- You're not meant to stay who you were last year, last month or even yesterday
- Sometimes you'll feel like a stranger to your old self, and that's okay. That means you are moving
- Let got of who you were, and embrace who you're becoming, because the river never stops flowing; and neither do you[^1]
- Change is how new chapters are written, you just have to be willing to turn the page

[^1]:1. Ecclesiastes 3:1 - There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens
