- You can't have a heart that's hateless, but you can have a heart that hates less
- Hate is easy, but it drains you slowly, it robs your peace. It poisons you more than it punishes them
- Love frees you. It doesn't mean forgetting, pretending it didn't hurt
- It means refusing to let the pain turn you into someone you are not
- A heart that hates less makes room for peace and peace is worth protecting[^1]
- You can't walk in love while dragging hate behind you
- Sooner or later, one has to let go

[^1]:1. 1 John 4:20 - Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.
