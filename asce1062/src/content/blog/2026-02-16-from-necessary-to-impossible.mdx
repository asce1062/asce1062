- Start by doing what's necessary. Then do what's possible
- And suddenly, you're doing the impossible
- Greatness begins with discipline. The necessary builds structure, the possible builds momentum
- And momentum when sustained, builds belief
- The impossible is often just the necessary repeated[^1]
- When you master the small steps long enough, the big steps stop intimidating you

[^1]:1. Mark 9:23 - “‘If you can’?” said Jesus. “Everything is possible for one who believes.”
