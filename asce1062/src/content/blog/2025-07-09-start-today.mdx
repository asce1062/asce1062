- Never give up on a dream because of the time it will take, the time will pass anyway
- One year from now, you'll be wishing you started today
- Five years will go by with or without your effort
- The dream doesn't wait, the clock doesn't care, but you can choose what you do with it
- Progress takes time, but regret lasts even longer
- Time's moving regardless, you might as well let it move you forward[^1]
- Whatever is holding you back - whether it's the fear, the doubt, or the opinions of others; it does not compare to the strength and purpose that lives within you
- Think of all you can accomplish if you moved past these
- The time will pass anyway, but now it's in your hands

[^1]:1. Hebrews 13:6 - So we say with confidence, “The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?”
