- Every day might not be good, but there is something good in every day
- Not every sunrise looks like hope, but hope still rises
- The day may bruise you, but it also offers breath. And sometimes, that's enough
- Even in the hardest days, there's still soft corners left behind
- Look for them and let them remind you that the world is still full of gentle things[^1]
- The day itself is a miracle. Everything good within it is simply Grace unfolding
- There's beauty in the overlooked. A quiet moment, a kind word, a second wind you didn't see coming

[^1]:1. Psalm 118:24 - The Lord has done it this very day; let us rejoice today and be glad.
