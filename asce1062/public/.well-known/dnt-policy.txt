SCOPE

This is a personal, static website built with Astro and hosted on Netlify.
It does not serve ads, embed third-party tracking scripts, or collect user
credentials. There are no authenticated sections, user accounts, or login
flows. The site is also available at asce1062.github.io/asce1062 via
GitHub Pages.

SAME-PARTY DOMAINS

The following domains are operated by the same party and serve the same content:
- alexmbugua.me (primary, hosted on Netlify)
- asce1062.github.io/asce1062 (alternate, hosted on GitHub Pages)

TRACKING STATUS

This site does not track visitors. The tracking status value is "N"
(Not Tracking), as declared in /.well-known/dnt.

DATA COLLECTION

This site does not:
- Track you
- Run analytics
- Set cookies
- Fingerprint browsers or devices
- Collect or store personally identifiable information
- Share data with third-party advertisers or data brokers
- Serve targeted advertisements

SESSION STORAGE

This site writes to session storage so that your chosen dark/light mode
persists as you navigate. This disappears the moment you close the tab
or browse away.

FORMS

The only data received from you is that which you freely give through the
email or guestbook forms. These are powered by Netlify Forms
(https://www.netlify.com/platform/core/forms/), which sends input through
Akismet (https://akismet.com/) spam filtering. Should you want a copy or
would like anything you sent deleted, contact us (see below).

SERVER LOGS

Standard server logs (IP addresses, User Agent strings) may be retained by
the hosting providers for operational and security purposes:
- Netlify (https://www.netlify.com) — primary host
- GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com) — alternate host

These logs are not used for tracking and are subject to each provider's
own privacy policy.

THIRD-PARTY RESOURCES

Where third-party resources are embedded (e.g. fonts, external links), they
are used for functionality only and not for tracking purposes.
